# Mirror2RearUltra
Simplistic rear screen mirroring plugin/app for Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra. Does nothing more other than mirror the front screen to your rear one.

There is no user interface, everything is done through the provided quick tile.

Works on Android 11+ with any MIUI version after 12.

# Usage
Press the quick tile to enable rear screen mirroring. Home screen shortcuts must be enabled in permissions for quick tile to show. Make sure MIUI power saver is off so that the app doesn't get killed.

# Bugs
- Sometimes the confirmation dialog will appear on the rear screen. (fixed with 1.0-final, report to me if it does happen again.)
- You may have to wake up the screen by double tapping on it. (fixed with 1.0-final)
- Double tapping will increase brightness. (fixed with 1.0-final)

# Special Thanks To...
1. Xiaomi for making the Mi 11 Ultra...
2. Google for providing the tools necessary to make this...
3. And you for downloading the app; without you, this app would of never existed.
